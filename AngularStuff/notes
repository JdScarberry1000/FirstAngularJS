ANGULAR NOTES

AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a simple script tag.

ng-app is a directive that we put into our HTML page to define it as an AngularJS application. (ng-app="myAppName")

AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications. AngularJS controllers are regular JavaScript Objects 
that contain variables and functions. We put ng-controller in an HTML div tag to 'import' the controller.
